FBB8DOMPqW8,2024-08-09T08:37:46.000000,Overview on SaaS,hi welcome to the course on SAS I'm darar ji I'm going to be an instructor for giving an overview on software as a service let's get started before we begin on software as a service let's try to understand what are the other Cloud distribution models that we have in the market the first one is the on premise although it is not as Cloud distribution model it is essential to understand what onr solution are as you can see the picture the on drers is fully represented in the green in the bottom you could see the legend that you actually manage the entire stack that means you have to manage your networking layer storage servers and your virtualization layer on top of it you have your operating system and now you'll be working on your application layer right you'll be setting up your custom application to interact with the operating system to get your task 10 so assume if you're going to have the setup for your Enterprise startup or if you're own developer Network this is going to be a big bottleneck to manage how about a infrastructure as service this is where the cloud comes into play the infrastructure as service platform as a service and software service are provided by some service provider who manage the enter Cloud infrastructure for infrastructure Service as you could see in the D in the picture the networking storage servers and virtualization are managed by them that means they provide the infrastructure for you all you have to do is just get your own operating system and your runtime and the application and its corresponding data what is platform as a service here in platform as a service the operating system and the runtime are provided by the service providers all you have to get is just the application code and the corresponding data and you have to deploy somewhere in the cloud now our topic of the day which is softwares of service the softwares of service where all of them that we discussed now are managed by the service providers that means you don't have to worry about hosting infrastructure or managing those Network related stuffs so everything is managed by the service providers and all you have to do is just go and use it what is typically required for using a SAS product as you could see in the slide you need an internet because these applications are hosted by a service provider somewhere in in their own cloud setup so via internet You' be accessing these products one typical example that we have today is Gmail right that you have been used predominant for decades so to access a Gmail you get onto a computer that has an internet connectivity open your browser hit mail.google.com and that's it you're connected to a as product already you manage your own mailbox draft a mail send it see this becomes real easy without needing a setup in your local and that's where you have to understand the difference between the traditional software model versus the SAS in SAS you don't have to purchase a product install it or main at your end whereas older days for the traditional software model you have been doing that you go to a sh purchase a CD and install it in your machine and maintain it for each version upgrade that becomes a big bottleneck here let's understand the key characteristics of SAS of course it is hosted on cloud somewhere you don't have to know that and coming to the subscription base SAS is typically offered on a subscription basis which can be monthly or annual this model provides predicable cost and often includes updates and support within the subscription fee next is scalability SAS Solutions can scale with your business needs whether need to add more users or integrate with other system SAS applications can grow with you automatic updates unlike traditional software which require manual updates SAS up applications are updated automatically by service provider this ensures that user always have access to the latest features and security improvements without any additional effort what are the benefits of SAS SS offers numerous benefits that make it an attractive option for business of all sizes first is cost effective SAS eliminates the need for costly hardware and reduces the need for ID staff to manage installations and Updates this lowers the overall cost of ownership next is accessibility and collaboration with SAS your team can access the software from anywhere fostering better collaboration and productivity this is especially valuable in today's remote work enrollment quick implementation SAS application are typically ready to use out of the box allowing business to get up on running quickly this reduce the time to value and accelerate business processes security and compliance last but not the least leading SAS providers invest heavily in security and compliance often providing better protection that many organization could achieve on on their own they offer features like data encryption regular security audits compliance with industry standards Etc what are a popular SAS solution that we have in the market today the first one is customer relationship management platform that is Salesforce that helps business manage their sales customer service and marketing activities the next Microsoft 365 of course you would know a suit of productivity tools including word excel PowerPoint and Outlook all accessible via Cloud the next is slack a collaboration tool that allows team to collaborate in real time share files and integrate with other software application Zoom a video conferencing tool that has become essential for remote work and viral meetings of course the lost but not the least you have seen the Google workspace where you have a Gmail or Google Drive YouTube and what not let's see what are few factors that you need to consider for choosing a SAS prodect functionality ensure the software meets your specific business needs and integrate well with your existing systems user experience software should be user friendly and intuitive to minimize the learning curve for your team security verify that the provider has robust security measures in place to protect your data support and training look for providers that offer excellent customer support and training resources to help you make the most of the software all right here you could see the Google workspace and what are the application and few of the softwares that it offers as a package most promin you have seen Gmail meet chat calendar Drive dogs sheets slides
