FBB8DOMPqW8,2024-08-09T08:37:46.000000,Overview on SaaS,hi welcome to the course on SAS I'm darar ji I'm going to be an instructor for giving an overview on software as a service let's get started before we begin on software as a service let's try to understand what are the other Cloud distribution models that we have in the market the first one is the on premise although it is not as Cloud distribution model it is essential to understand what onr solution are as you can see the picture the on drers is fully represented in the green in the bottom you could see the legend that you actually manage the entire stack that means you have to manage your networking layer storage servers and your virtualization layer on top of it you have your operating system and now you'll be working on your application layer right you'll be setting up your custom application to interact with the operating system to get your task 10 so assume if you're going to have the setup for your Enterprise startup or if you're own developer Network this is going to be a big bottleneck to manage how about a infrastructure as service this is where the cloud comes into play the infrastructure as service platform as a service and software service are provided by some service provider who manage the enter Cloud infrastructure for infrastructure Service as you could see in the D in the picture the networking storage servers and virtualization are managed by them that means they provide the infrastructure for you all you have to do is just get your own operating system and your runtime and the application and its corresponding data what is platform as a service here in platform as a service the operating system and the runtime are provided by the service providers all you have to get is just the application code and the corresponding data and you have to deploy somewhere in the cloud now our topic of the day which is softwares of service the softwares of service where all of them that we discussed now are managed by the service providers that means you don't have to worry about hosting infrastructure or managing those Network related stuffs so everything is managed by the service providers and all you have to do is just go and use it what is typically required for using a SAS product as you could see in the slide you need an internet because these applications are hosted by a service provider somewhere in in their own cloud setup so via internet You' be accessing these products one typical example that we have today is Gmail right that you have been used predominant for decades so to access a Gmail you get onto a computer that has an internet connectivity open your browser hit mail.google.com and that's it you're connected to a as product already you manage your own mailbox draft a mail send it see this becomes real easy without needing a setup in your local and that's where you have to understand the difference between the traditional software model versus the SAS in SAS you don't have to purchase a product install it or main at your end whereas older days for the traditional software model you have been doing that you go to a sh purchase a CD and install it in your machine and maintain it for each version upgrade that becomes a big bottleneck here let's understand the key characteristics of SAS of course it is hosted on cloud somewhere you don't have to know that and coming to the subscription base SAS is typically offered on a subscription basis which can be monthly or annual this model provides predicable cost and often includes updates and support within the subscription fee next is scalability SAS Solutions can scale with your business needs whether need to add more users or integrate with other system SAS applications can grow with you automatic updates unlike traditional software which require manual updates SAS up applications are updated automatically by service provider this ensures that user always have access to
